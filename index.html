		   <div class="section_content">
		   <p>I want to be part of a company such as EPAM, because 
			   I know that I can bring my own benefit to it. I really
				want to work in a team because it is very difficult for
				 one person to work on a project for a long time, and
				  sometimes I don’t have enough knowledge. The team has
				   the opportunity to learn from each other. I can and
					I like to solve the tasks, I am diligent and curious
					 and I can work for hours until the problem is solved.
					  I have such a skill that I can understand and use
					   complex programs, for example, such as 3d-Max.
						I learn fast.</p>
