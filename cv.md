#### Summary
   I want to be part of a company such as EPAM, because I know that I can bring my own benefit to it. I really want to work in a team because it is very difficult for one person to work on a project for a long time, and sometimes I donâ€™t have enough knowledge. The team has the opportunity to learn from each other. I can and I like to solve the tasks, I am diligent and curious and I can work for hours until the problem is solved.
